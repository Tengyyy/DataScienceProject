<b>The motivation and goal of the project:</b><br>
The Basketball Hall of Fame is an institution that honors individuals who have made significant contributions to the sport of basketball. The selection is done by a committee and is often subjective. Almost all the players selected have spent most of their career in the NBA, which is the league with the highest competition in the world. Our main goal was to determine which statistics are the most important features in being selected for the Hall of Fame. Based on these features, we aimed to predict the current NBA players' probabilities of making the Hall of Fame using different models<br>

<b>A guide to the contents of the repository:</b><br>
The repository contains a notebook file "project.ipynb" which contains all the calculations made in this project. The data used for the project can be found in the "data" folder. To replicate the same analysis as we have done, one has to just simply run the notebook cells in order from top to bottom.
